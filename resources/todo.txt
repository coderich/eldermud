* The ROOM has to have a fallback for what you are looking at
* Talk vs Greet <NPC>
* Quit or Logout to disconnect
* Sit vs Rest vs Sleep?
* Pray
* Scan? and if so, then look should only be for direction

! Creatures are not attacking when they spawn (only when you enter room) (scan?)
! If you kill a creature does it still hit you? (it should be possible to trade blows...)

* Combat Mechanics
  - I like the idea of combat tactics; how many things you can perform in a given round (ie swing and use potion)
  - How about channeling abilities?
  - Moments of opportunity? Player off-balance?

* Need class/race combos
  - Leaving things open-ended is not good; the player needs a vision and direction
  - I like the idea that classes and races have set attribute boosts per level and special traits/abilities
