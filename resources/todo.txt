* Combat Mechanics
  - I like the idea of combat tactics; how many things you can perform in a given round (ie swing and use potion)
  - How about channeling abilities?
  - Moments of opportunity? Player off-balance?

**
- give => accept?
- talent: cooldown, limited uses (until rest)?
- rest: limited uses? tent? tavern/inn?
- dynamic creature traits: aggressive|large|small etc
- illness (status effect)
- item req to perform? (shovel => bury)
- corpse limitations
- hired help; telepath @do heal rand
- room visibility (dark, torch, etc)
- attack vs weapon
- armor slots
- train
- drag unit?
- REDIS: sMembers, sAdd, sRem, incrBy, incr, sIsMember (inventory)
- draw creature aggression
- creature re-targeting
- party ranks effect combat...
- shops; buy reasonable weapon
- main menu: enter, about, help?
- item progression
