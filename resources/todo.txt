* Combat Mechanics
  - I like the idea of combat tactics; how many things you can perform in a given round (ie swing and use potion)
  - How about channeling abilities?
  - Moments of opportunity? Player off-balance?

**
- train
- talents
- creature re-targeting
- draw creature aggression

- give => accept?
- talent: cooldown, limited uses (until rest)?
- rest: limited uses? tent? tavern/inn?
- dynamic creature traits: aggressive|large|small etc
- illness (status effect)
- item req to perform? (shovel => bury)
- corpse limitations
- hired help; telepath @do heal rand
- room visibility (dark, torch, etc)
- REDIS: sMembers, sAdd, sRem, incrBy, incr, sIsMember (inventory)
- party ranks effect combat...
- main menu: enter, about, help?
- item progression matrix
- target range vs source range - distance can be up to 5 (out of range!)
- Terrain (buffs, debuffs, movement, off-balance-checks, etc)
- room points-of-interest (eg. fountain); touch fountain +1 str etc
- actions/gestures list
- blockades/paths as first-class citizens with attached behavior...
- drop when below zero hp, bleeding?, aid command? drag command? death hp a % of your max hp?
