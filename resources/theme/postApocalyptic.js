  description: `
    Post-Apocalyptic is a genre of fiction that imagines a future in which civilization has collapsed due to catastrophic events such as nuclear war, pandemic, or environmental disaster.
    In a Post-Apocalyptic MUD, players might find themselves navigating through ruined cities, surviving in harsh environments, and fighting off mutated creatures.
    The races and classes in a Post-Apocalyptic world could include survivors, mutants, and other post-apocalyptic entities.
    Magic is less common in this theme, replaced by survival skills and resource management.
    The theme is known for its desolate and desperate atmosphere, its focus on survival and adaptation, and its exploration of the human capacity for resilience in the face of extreme adversity.
