  description: `
    Steampunk is a genre of speculative fiction that blends elements of Victorian-era steam-powered machinery with fantastical elements.
    In a Steampunk MUD, players might find themselves navigating through intricate mechanical cities, battling clockwork creatures, and uncovering secrets hidden in the heart of ancient machines.
    The races and classes in a Steampunk world could include humans augmented with mechanical parts, automatons, and other steam-powered entities.
    Magic is less common in this theme, replaced by steam-powered technology and mechanical engineering skills.
    The theme is known for its industrial aesthetics, its focus on innovation and progress, and its exploration of the potential consequences of unchecked technological advancement.
