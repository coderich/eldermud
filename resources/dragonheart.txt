Key Player-Selectable Elements & Customization

Classes & Subclasses: At character creation you pick one of ~10 core classes (Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, Rogue, Ranger, Druid, Fighter, Seraph, Warrior, Guardian) and then choose a foundation subclass card to refine your focus.

Heritage: You combine an Ancestry card (your race) with a Community card (your upbringing/environment) to flavor both stats and story.

Character Traits: Distribute modifiers (−1, 0, 0, +1, +1, +2) across six traits—Agility, Strength, Finesse, Instinct, Presence, Knowledge—that you’ll add to rolls.

Background & Experiences: Pick narrative “Background” options, then generate two free-form Experiences (phrases + +2 bonus) reflecting what your character has learned.

Domain Deck Cards: Each class has two domains; at 1st level you choose two cards (and gain more each level), shaping your abilities and playstyle.

Equipment & Armor: Select starting weapons and armor; armor grants Damage Thresholds and Armor Slots you’ll mark to soak damage.

Level-Up Upgrades: Every time you advance, you pick two options from a broad upgrade list (proficiency, new traits, HP, Stress tools, domain cards, multiclassing, etc.), giving far more per-level customization than many other RPGs.

Player Resources & Tokens

Hope & Fear: Central to narrative flow. Hope tokens fuel player benefits; Fear tokens fuel GM moves and complications.

Stress & Hit Points: Manage Stress as a currency for mechanical or narrative effects; HP tracks physical well-being.

Loadout & Experiences: Your deck of domain cards (“loadout”) and narrative Experiences are tactical resources you can swap or spend.

Core Dice Mechanic

Roll 2 × d12, sum both dice against a Difficulty target. One die is designated Hope, the other Fear—the higher of the two adds that token on every roll.

This bell-curve approach smooths probabilities and ensures every roll yields narrative tension.

Spending Tokens

Players spend Hope to help an ally, use an Experience, initiate a Tag Team Roll, or activate special Hope features.

GM spends Fear to interrupt, make extra moves, spotlight adversaries, trigger enemy/environment Fear features, or add Experiences to rolls.

Combat & Damage

After a hit, roll your weapon’s damage dice equal to your Proficiency, add total.

On a critical success (both dice tie), max one die then roll as usual for extra damage.
