  description: `
    Dark Fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that focuses on the darker, more sinister side of fantasy.
    It often features a more grim and brutal setting, with a heavy emphasis on violence, death, and darkness.
    The races and classes in a Dark Fantasy world could include monstrous creatures, demonic entities, and other malevolent forces.
    Magic is commonplace in this theme, but it's often used for evil purposes.
    The theme is known for its bleak and oppressive atmosphere, its focus on despair and hopelessness, and its exploration of the darker aspects of human nature.
