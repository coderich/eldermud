  "description": "A forgotten hospice beneath the Chapel of Eldenfort, where the sick were brought to recover or die. Now, it is a place of silence, memory, and undeath.",
  "backstory": "\n    Once a center of mercy for the afflicted, the Sanatorium was built beneath the chapel to shield the healthy from the horrors of the Plague.\n    Over time, it became less a place of healing and more a tomb. Wardens sealed its gates, prayers were whispered, and then forgotten.\n\n    You awaken inside it, touched by the fever, yet alive. Something is different. You do not remember who you were.\n    The answers lie within the depthsâ€”and your path forward begins with a choice of identity among the memories of the dead.\n  ",
