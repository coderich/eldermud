Baron's wife alleges theivery in the small town of Firebend
Sheriff ordered lockdown due to pressure from Baron himself
City guards stationed at each gate
Barracks has army, but they aren't quick to act to chase a ghost
Most townfolk are not worried and waiting for the missing item(s) to magically reappear and back to normal

Outside of marketplace a shady character is waiting for the weaponsmith to show his face and settle a score
The weaponsmith is MIA and the shady guy feels he's ducking him, he wants to fight/combat
You can go check to see if weaponsmith is there for him (he's not) since he feels he runs if he gets near
If you do this the shady guy will give you his extra pocket knife since he's upgraded for the impending battle

Under the marketplace is a storage room with a few rats/ants and boxes (chests). The boxes will contain various items to aid in the quest. (torch, armor)

The weaponsmith guy happened to spot an odd mirage and followed it into hidden tunnels
There the weaponsmith encountered kobolds, fought many off, but fell into a trap and is deep down in a hole
Find weaponsmith and he'll share what he knows, impart his gauntlet of strength + weapon to you, and wish you luck
Will require rope and grapple to "go hole" and climb back out

The Baron's wife does not know exactly what's missing. She heard noise and spotted a small, almost reptilian-like figure, scuttling away into the darkness at night. She knows something was taken.

Behind the Baron's house is a secret door, covered in debris, that leads to underground storage
Long forgotten you will find spiders, some cheap clothes (armor), and the hidden tunnel behind a giant crate (move crate?)
